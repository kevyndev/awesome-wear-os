   - Why it belongs in the list
   - Confirmation that it's actively maintained

## Format Guidelines

### Basic Entry Format

```markdown
- [App Name](link) - Brief description.
```

For open source projects:

```markdown
- [App Name](store-link) - Brief description. [(source code)](repo-link)
```

> [!TIP]
> Add a brief description after the link and add proper punctuation. Keep descriptions concise and focused on the main functionality of your app.

> [!TIP]
> If your project's store link and source code link are the same, we recommend using the open-source entry format to highlight that your project is open-source.

> [!NOTE]
> If your project is a fork of a project on this list, create a subitem with your project:
>
> ```md
> [OWNER/REPO_NAME](https://github.com/...) - Description of your fork.
> ```
>
> Make sure you highlight why your fork is better than the parent project.

### Examples

> [!TIP]
> For open source projects, always link both the store listing and source code repository.

Closed source paid app:

```markdown
- [Sleep Monitor Pro](https://play.google.com/...) - Advanced sleep tracking with heart rate monitoring.
```

Open source free app:

```markdown
- [Battery Widget](https://play.google.com/...) - Simple tile showing battery levels of watch and phone. [(source code)](https://github.com/...)
```

> [!WARNING]
> Ensure all links are permanent and point to Google Play or a GitHub release (or similar), not to specific versions or temporary locations.

### Category Structure

Apps should be placed in appropriate categories and subcategories:

```markdown
### Category Name

- [Free App 1](link) - short description of app.
- [Free App 2](link) - short description of app.

<details open>
<summary>🪙 Apps with in app purchases</summary>

<!-- Add your app here if it has IAPs -->
</details>

<details>
<summary>💰 Paid apps</summary>

<!-- Add your app here if it's paid -->
</details>
```

> [!NOTE]
> The free apps will come first. App's with in app purchases and that are paid will come after and will be collapsible so that users can see app's that align with their pricing preference.

> [!TIP]
> If your app fits multiple categories, choose the most relevant one or discuss in your PR which category makes the most sense.
